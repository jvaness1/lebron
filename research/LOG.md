## 2026-06-11 · seed · baseline established by the interactive session
- Live strategy: cross-sectional momentum, 24-coin universe, 30d lookback, weekly
  rebalance, long top-5 / short bottom-5, dollar-neutral, size 0.3. Backtest
  (survivorship-mitigated, ~480d OOS): +143% / Sharpe ~1.3 while market −32%.
  Robust across K3/5/8 and the parameter neighbourhood. Deployed to Railway paper.
- Data depth used: ~1,200 daily bars (~3.3y) × ~24 coins; ~68 weekly OOS periods
  (modest sample — main known weakness alongside survivorship).
- Rebalance-frequency test (30d signal): weekly Sharpe 1.67 ≫ daily 0.53. BUT a
  later daily-rebalance lookback sweep hinted 14d/K3/daily → +179%/1.42 OOS
  (IN-SAMPLE-SELECTED — unvalidated; see backlog P1).
- Prior dead ends (do not revisit without a new angle): RSI dip-buy (no edge after
  costs); Donchian 1h breakout (worked on SOL, did NOT generalise — 43% of coins
  positive, equal-weight ~flat); all intraday/HF strategies (killed by taker fees;
  only viable at maker ≤~3bps/side).
